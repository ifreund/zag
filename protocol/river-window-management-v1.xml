  <description summary="frame-perfect window management">
    This protocol allows a single "window manager" client to determine the
    window management policy of the compositor. State is globally
    double-buffered allowing for frame perfect state changes involving multiple
    windows.

    The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
    "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can only
    be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        The Wayland protocol is asynchronous, which means the server may send
        further events until the stop request is processed. The client must wait

        If a client wishes to destroy this object it should send a

    <event name="update">
      <description summary="all new state has been sent">
        This event is used to group state update events sent to the client into
        a single, atomic update.

        Since some state changes require action from the window manager client
        for frame perfection, the client should update the necessary state,
        ack_update, and commit as soon as possible on receiving an update event.

        For example, when the dimensions of a window change it may be necessary
        for the window manager to resize its decoration surfaces to match. In
        this case the compositor may wait for the window manager client to
        adjust the decoration surface size, ack_update, and commit before
        rendering the window at its new size to avoid imperfect frames where the
        decoration surface size does not match the window size.

        request before the commit request with the serial of that update event.

        If the client receives multiple update events before it can respond to
        one, only the most recent update event must be acked.

        A client may send multiple ack_update requests before committing. The
        last request sent before a commit indicates which update event the
        commit is in response to.

        It is a protocol error to issue multiple ack_update requests referencing
        the same update event or to issue an ack_update request referencing an
        update event older than the last update event acked.

      <description summary="give keyboard focus to a shell_surface">
        Request that the compositor send keyboard input to the given shell
        surface.

        Despite this request, the compositor may temporarily give keyboard focus
        to a wlr-layer-shell client requesting exclusive focus or similar if the
        compositor supports such a protocol. In such a case, the compositor
        should return focus to the specified shell surface when the conditions
        that caused the window manager's request to be overruled no longer hold.

    <event name="pointer_enter">
      <description summary="pointer entered a window">
        The seat's pointer entered the given window's area.

        The area of a window is defined to include the area defined by the
        window dimensions, borders configured using river_window_v1.set_borders,
        and the input regions of decoration surfaces. In particular, it does not
        include input regions of surfaces belonging to the window that extend
        outside the window dimensions.

        The pointer of a seat may only enter a single window at a time. When the
        pointer moves between windows, the pointer_leave event for the old
        window must be sent before the pointer_enter event for the new window.

        This event is double-buffered state and will be followed by a
        river_window_manager_v1.update event.

      <description summary="pointer moved">
        The seat's pointer moved. The x and y coordinates are in the
        compositor's logical coordinate space.

        Rationale: pointer motion events in some form are necessary to implement
        the "always" style of focus-follows-cursor. Choosing to expose global
        pointer position/motion information to the window manager rather than
        motion events relative to a window allows other potentially interesting
        features, for example hot corners.

    <event name="window_interaction">
      <description summary="a window has been interacted with">
        A window has been interacted with beyond the pointer merely passing over
        it. This event might be sent due to a pointer button press or due to a
        touch/tablet tool interaction with the window.

        There are no guarantees regarding how this event is sent in relation to
        the pointer_enter and pointer_leave events as the interaction may use
        touch or tablet tool input.

        Rationale: this event gives window managers necessary information to
        determine when to send keyboard focus, raise a window that already has
        keyboard focus, etc. Rather than expose all pointer, touch, and tablet
        events to window managers, a policy over mechanism approach is taken.

        river_window_manager_v1.update event.

    <request name="pointer_resize_window">

        This request causes the a window to be resized from the specified edges,
        updating the position/dimensions of the window as while the pointer is
        moved. Multiple windows may be interactively resized at the same time.

        The interactive resize is ended when all pointer buttons are released.
        This request is ignored if no pointer buttons are held.

        It is a protocol error to set the edges argument to none. It is also an
        error to set both the top and bottom edges or both the left and right
        edges. Resizing from, for example, both the top and right edges is
        allowed.
