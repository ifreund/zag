  <description summary="frame-perfect window management">
    This protocol allows a single "window manager" client to determine the
    window management policy of the compositor. State is globally
    double-buffered allowing for frame perfect state changes involving multiple
    windows.

    The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
    "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can only
    be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        This request indicates that the client no longer wishes to receive
        events on this object.

        The Wayland protocol is asynchronous, which means the server may send
        further events until the stop request is processed. The client must wait
        for a river_window_manager_v1.finished event before destroying this
        object.

        If a client wishes to destroy this object it should send a
        river_window_manager_v1.stop request and wait for a
        river_window_manager_v1.finished event. Once the finished event is
        received it is safe to destroy this object and any other objects created
